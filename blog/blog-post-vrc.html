            <p class="blog-post-lead">Our customer is a leading vital-records processing provider.</p>
            
            <p>Their technology underpins vital statistics systems for multiple state health departments, powering services such as:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Birth and death certificate processing</li>
                <li>Identity verification for public programs</li>
                <li>Epidemiological and public-health reporting</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Every day, their platform handles large volumes of highly sensitive healthcare documents under strict HIPAA and state regulations.</p>
            
            <p>To keep up with growing demand after the pandemic, they needed a new way to handle complex, multi-page medical and identity documents faster, more accurately, and at lower cost—without compromising compliance.</p>
            
            <p>Working closely with AWS, we helped them build a Generative AI–powered document processing platform on Amazon SageMaker and a fully serverless data plane on AWS. The result: turnaround times dropped from days to minutes, accuracy now reaches 98–99%, and manual effort has been reduced by 60–75%.</p>

            <h2>The challenge: complex healthcare documents at massive scale</h2>
            
            <p>Our customer's quality control and identity document workflows sit at the heart of state-level vital records:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Thousands of PDFs per day, often scanned from different systems, resolutions, and layouts</li>
                <li>Multiple patients and facilities mentioned in a single document</li>
                <li>Facility names with 10–15 different aliases across state and federal databases</li>
                <li>Strict 24-hour processing deadlines and HIPAA requirements</li>
                <li>Heavy, expensive manual adjudication whenever systems couldn't match data automatically</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Existing approaches were hitting the wall:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Traditional OCR and rules were brittle across layouts and states.</li>
                <li>Previous cloud-based pipelines for some workloads could take hours per batch, creating bottlenecks.</li>
                <li>Third-party OCR services and manual specialists were costing millions of dollars per year.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Without change, they faced:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Unsustainable processing costs</li>
                <li>Growing risk of SLA breaches and regulatory penalties</li>
                <li>Inability to onboard new states and programs quickly</li>
                <li>Competitive pressure from vendors adopting AI-driven automation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>They needed a platform that could understand complex healthcare documents like a human reviewer, but run at cloud scale and speed.</p>

            <h2>Why they chose Generative AI on AWS</h2>
            
            <p>Together with our customer, we evaluated three main options:</p>
            
            <ol class="blog-list">
                <li>Enhancing the manual process with a more modern document management system</li>
                <li>Classic OCR + rules and regexes for pattern matching</li>
                <li>Custom-trained ML models running on self-managed GPU infrastructure</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Each option had tradeoffs: high labor cost, poor robustness to layout changes, long MLOps build-out, or significant operational overhead.</p>
            
            <p>We ultimately chose Generative AI on AWS because it offered:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Multimodal document understanding with a vision-language model hosted on Amazon SageMaker</li>
                <li>A fully managed, serverless data plane built on Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon OpenSearch Service</li>
                <li>Native security, encryption, and observability aligned with HIPAA and state requirements</li>
                <li>Rapid time-to-value through Infrastructure as Code with AWS CDK and automated CI/CD</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This approach allowed us to focus on prompts, evaluation, and business rules while AWS handled undifferentiated heavy lifting like GPU provisioning, scaling, and multi-AZ resilience.</p>

            <h2>Solution overview: from PDF to trusted data in minutes</h2>
            
            <p>At the heart of the solution is a Generative AI pipeline on AWS that turns incoming PDFs into structured, searchable data ready for downstream systems.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Secure ingest on AWS</h3>
            <p>State systems and healthcare partners submit PDFs to Amazon S3, where they are encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS).</p>
            <p>An Amazon SQS queue buffers work and decouples uploads from processing. A lightweight AWS Lambda function ("start processing") reads from the queue and kicks off an AWS Step Functions state machine.</p>
            <p><strong>AWS at work:</strong> S3 + SQS + Lambda + Step Functions provide a fully managed, event-driven backbone that absorbs bursts without manual capacity planning.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Orchestrated document pipeline with AWS Step Functions</h3>
            <p>The Step Functions workflow coordinates the full lifecycle:</p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li><strong>PDF → JPEG conversion</strong> – pages are split into images and normalized for AI processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Patient and page analysis</strong> – map states parallelize processing across pages and patient segments.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Extraction</strong> – each page or patient "chunk" is sent to the Generative AI model.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy calculation & QC scoring</strong> – extracted fields are validated, scored, and prepared for human review where needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Every step emits structured logs to Amazon CloudWatch, making it easy to trace a single document from upload to final result.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Multimodal Generative AI with Amazon SageMaker</h3>
            <p>For the AI engine, our customer selected a leading vision-language model hosted on Amazon SageMaker.</p>
            <p>The model ingests both the image of the page and extracted text, then outputs structured JSON with patient details, facilities, requesters, and key medical fields.</p>
            <p>Asynchronous inference uses S3 input/output locations to handle heavy workloads without blocking callers.</p>
            <p>Model metrics like latency and error rates are monitored via CloudWatch and power autoscaling policies.</p>
            <p>This gives them the sophistication of a cutting-edge multimodal LLM with the reliability of a production-ready managed service.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Durable data foundation with DynamoDB and OpenSearch</h3>
            <p>Once extraction and validation are complete:</p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Amazon DynamoDB stores file metadata, processing status, and the key patient fields needed for downstream systems and reporting.</li>
                <li>Amazon OpenSearch Service indexes the full text and selected fields, enabling fast search and reviewer workflows.</li>
                <li>Final JSON outputs are written back to an encrypted S3 output bucket for audit, reprocessing, or data-lake applications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All storage is encrypted with AWS KMS, and access is controlled via least-privilege IAM roles.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Access, security, and governance</h3>
            <p>Security is non-negotiable in healthcare. The platform uses a defense-in-depth AWS design:</p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Amazon Cognito enforces strong authentication and optional MFA for review applications and APIs.</li>
                <li>All APIs are fronted by Amazon API Gateway with HTTPS/TLS only, request throttling, and detailed access logging.</li>
                <li>VPC-isolated Lambda and SageMaker endpoints communicate via locked-down security groups and VPC endpoints; no database or search cluster is publicly accessible.</li>
                <li>AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config provide full audit trails and configuration visibility.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure is defined with AWS CDK, enforced with cdk-nag security checks, and deployed through a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline (dev → QA → prod).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key AWS services at the core of the solution</h2>
            
            <p>Although we do not publish the full architecture diagram, the platform is built entirely on AWS and relies on the following managed services:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li><strong>Amazon SageMaker</strong> – Multimodal endpoint for Generative AI document understanding</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Step Functions</strong> – orchestration of the PDF→JPEG→extraction→accuracy pipeline</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> – event-driven processing and micro-tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon S3</strong> – input, async inference artifacts, and output archives</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon SQS</strong> – decoupled ingestion and back-pressure handling</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> – file metadata and extracted field store</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service</strong> – search and analytics over extracted content</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon API Gateway & Amazon Cognito</strong> – secure APIs and user authentication</li>
                <li><strong>AWS KMS, AWS Secrets Manager, AWS IAM, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config</strong> – encryption, secret management, and governance</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> – dashboards, metrics, logs, and alarms for the entire workload</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>AWS isn't just the hosting environment—it's the engine that powers the entire GenAI application.</p>

            <h2>Business results: days to minutes, at a fraction of the cost</h2>
            
            <p>The impact of the new AWS-based platform is clear and measurable.</p>
            
            <h3>Turnaround time: days → minutes</h3>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li><strong>Before:</strong> 1–2 business days per document, with queues and rework.</li>
                <li><strong>After:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Processing time reduced to minutes</li>
                        <li>Median time reduced by over 95%</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This allows them to comfortably meet same-day SLA commitments even under heavy load.</p>
            
            <h3>Accuracy and quality: towards 98–99% success</h3>
            <p>By combining multimodal Generative AI with a reviewer-in-the-loop workflow:</p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Baseline first-pass accuracy was 70–80% with manual / rules-based extraction.</li>
                <li>The new solution consistently delivers 98–99% "business success" on key patient, facility, and requester fields.</li>
                <li>Reviewer corrections have been cut by roughly 50%, freeing experts to focus on edge cases and new document types.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Cost and scalability: significant savings and increased throughput</h3>
            <p>Our customer has reduced manual document processing effort by 60–75%, with a corresponding drop in third-party OCR and adjudication costs.</p>
            <p>The serverless and SageMaker-based design scales to handle significantly higher throughput without proportional headcount increases.</p>
            <p>Modeling shows strong ROI and a payback period measured in months at current volumes.</p>
            
            <p>Behind the scenes, CloudWatch dashboards and KPI standards track:</p>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>API 5XX and latency</li>
                <li>Lambda p95 duration, errors, and throttles</li>
                <li>Step Functions failures and execution time</li>
                <li>SageMaker model latency and error rates</li>
                <li>DynamoDB and OpenSearch health</li>
            </ul>
            <p>…ensuring the platform stays within its strict SLAs.</p>

            <h2>Transforming vital-records processing with AWS Generative AI</h2>
            
            <p>For our customer, this project is more than a technical upgrade—it's a strategic transformation of how vital records are processed:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Citizens receive faster decisions and responses</li>
                <li>State health departments gain more timely, accurate data</li>
                <li>Compliance posture is stronger thanks to consistent encryption, access controls, and audit trails</li>
                <li>The platform is ready to onboard new states and document types without a complete redesign</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Generative AI on AWS turned a labor-heavy cost center into an intelligent, scalable document platform that supports the mission of public health.</p>
