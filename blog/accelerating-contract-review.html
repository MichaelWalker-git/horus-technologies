            <p class="blog-post-lead">How Horus Technologies built a contract-intelligence platform on AWS without increasing headcount</p>

            <h2>Business context</h2>
            
            <p>Horus Technologies partnered with an organization that manages a large portfolio of software and service contracts. Each renewal season, their legal and procurement teams had to review piles of order forms, SKUs, discounts, terms, and renewal clauses.</p>
            
            <p>The pain points were familiar:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li><strong>Slow reviews</strong> – A single complex contract could take a couple of hours to analyze end-to-end.</li>
                <li><strong>High stakes</strong> – Small mistakes in quantities, discounts, or term dates could lead to overpayment or missed savings opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Growing volume</strong> – As the business expanded, the number of contracts increased, but the review team did not.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited visibility</strong> – Data ended up in scattered spreadsheets, making it hard to see portfolio-wide pricing patterns or exceptions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The customer wanted to use generative AI to speed up contract reviews, but with strict requirements around accuracy, explainability, and security.</p>

            <h2>Project goals</h2>
            
            <p>Together we defined a set of business and technical objectives:</p>
            
            <h3>Business goals</h3>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Cut review time from hours to minutes per contract, especially during renewal waves.</li>
                <li>Reach high validated accuracy on key commercial and legal fields so analysts can trust the output.</li>
                <li>Help teams spot inconsistent pricing and terms across vendors and contracts.</li>
                <li>Increase throughput by an order of magnitude without adding headcount.</li>
                <li>Provide auditable, source-grounded evidence for internal approvals and vendor negotiations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Technical goals</h3>
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Run everything in a secure, multi-tenant AWS environment with clear data isolation.</li>
                <li>Use AWS generative AI services to extract and structure information from contract PDFs and similar documents.</li>
                <li>Offer a simple web UI and APIs so analysts can upload contracts, monitor processing, and download structured results.</li>
                <li>Implement monitoring and basic KPIs (latency, success rate, cost per contract) to continually optimize the platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>High-level solution</h2>
            
            <p>Horus Technologies implemented a contract-intelligence platform on AWS that:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Accepts contract files through a browser or API.</li>
                <li>Stores documents securely and triggers an automated review workflow.</li>
                <li>Uses generative AI on AWS to extract important fields and line items from contracts.</li>
                <li>Validates and structures the data into a consistent schema stored in a relational database.</li>
                <li>Generates downloadable reports (for example, spreadsheets) that analysts can use for review, approvals, and negotiations.</li>
                <li>Keeps a full link back to the original text, so every extracted value can be checked against the source document.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>All processing happens inside the customer's AWS account, using managed services and short-lived credentials. The platform is designed so that if a document fails automated checks, it is clearly flagged for manual review rather than silently accepted.</p>

            <h2>AWS services used in this project</h2>
            
            <p>To keep operations lean and security strong, Horus Technologies built the solution using fully-managed AWS services:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li><strong>Amazon CloudFront & Amazon S3</strong> – Deliver the single-page web application over HTTPS and store contract files and generated reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon API Gateway</strong> – Provides REST APIs for uploading documents, checking status, and downloading results.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> – Implements stateless functions for API handling, contract processing steps, and export generation.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Step Functions</strong> – Orchestrates the end-to-end review workflow for each document or batch of documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon Bedrock</strong> – Supplies foundation models used to interpret contract content and return structured data.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</strong> – Stores normalized contract data, line items, and review metadata in a relational schema.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> – Manages user authentication and integrates with identity providers as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager</strong> – Secures database credentials and other sensitive configuration.</li>
                <li><strong>Amazon CloudWatch</strong> – Collects logs and metrics and powers alerts on errors, latency, and other health signals.</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong> – Enforces least-privilege access to services and data.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This stack avoids custom infrastructure and keeps the platform portable to other AWS accounts or regions.</p>

            <h2>What Horus Technologies delivered</h2>
            
            <p>Within this project, Horus Technologies delivered a production-ready platform that:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Handles both single and bulk uploads of contracts through a web interface or automated systems.</li>
                <li>Processes contracts in minutes, returning structured fields and itemized pricing data for analyst review.</li>
                <li>Surfaces inconsistencies and exceptions (for example, unusual prices or terms) so teams know where to focus.</li>
                <li>Provides downloadable, review-friendly outputs that plug into the customer's existing workflows.</li>
                <li>Operates with transparent logging and status tracking, so operations teams can see what is happening at each step.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>All of this is built using patterns that can be adapted for other domains where high-risk documents need to be read, summarized, and checked quickly.</p>

            <h2>Business impact</h2>
            
            <p>The customer has reported significant improvements:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Review time per contract has dropped from hours to a small number of minutes of analyst effort.</li>
                <li>Teams can handle significantly more contracts per month without additional hiring.</li>
                <li>The platform helps identify potential overpayments and inconsistent terms earlier in the renewal cycle.</li>
                <li>The combination of AI plus clear source links has improved trust between procurement, legal, and finance teams.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Instead of replacing people, the system lets experts focus on judgment and negotiation, with repetitive extraction and structuring work handled by AWS-backed automation.</p>

            <h2>How this approach can be reused</h2>
            
            <p>The same pattern can be applied to other high-value document workflows:</p>
            
            <ul class="blog-list">
                <li>Vendor agreements and SOWs</li>
                <li>Insurance policies</li>
                <li>Healthcare or financial compliance documents</li>
                <li>Complex technical appendices that need standardization</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If your organization is dealing with time-consuming contract or document reviews and wants to explore secure, explainable generative AI on AWS, Horus Technologies can help design a solution that fits your governance and risk requirements—without exposing your business logic or competitive advantages.</p>
